###INTRO###

This is a project I did for my second year Data Structures and Algorithms
course. I added some extra functions for my own amusement. Although I
know I can optimize the code more, I am currently satisfied with it and
thus will let it rest in peace.


###NOTE###

There are two .cpp files included one is for integer inputs and the other for 
double inputs.
